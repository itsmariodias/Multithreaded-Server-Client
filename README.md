# Implementation of Multithreaded Client and Server Application in Java using Dispatcher-Worker Model.

### What is multithreading?
Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system process to manage its use by more than one user at a time and to even manage multiple requests by the same user without having to have multiple copies of the program running in the computer. 

### Multithreaded-Server:
A server that can handle multiple threads, where each thread is responsible to process a separate request from every client(user).

### Multithreaded-Client:
A client that can spawn multiple threads to fetch multiple resources from multiple servers simultaneously to prevent the user from being blocked by slow I/O operations.

### Dispatcher-Worker Model:
In this model, the process consist of one dispatcher thread and several worker threads. The dispatcher thread accepts the clientâ€™s request and chooses one of the free worker threads to handover this request for further processing. Hence, multiple client requests can be processed by multiple worker threads in parallel.

## Execution:
* Compile all files.
* Run `Server.java` first.
* To demonstrate single threaded client performance, run `SingleClient.java`
* To demonstrate multi threaded client performance, run `Client.java`
* List of tasks to execute is determined by `input.txt`
* Tasks defined as per `Task.java`
